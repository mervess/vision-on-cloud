# Cloud based Visual Recognisers

This repository involves a report as a result of an examination that I made [*on the side*](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1989) back in 2018. 

The report investigates the **features of web-based trained neural network APIs**. Additionally, the two folders in the repository contain sample output images obtained via regarding APIs. The APIs can be adapted to be used with various programming languages.

Back then, the winner seemed "Google-API" to me. I've made a quick re-check and it still seems like it. Below is a sample image output of the [Google API](https://cloud.google.com/vision#section-2).
